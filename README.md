# Detection-of-Cancer-Cell-using-ML
This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive guide to detecting cancer cells using cell dimensions and the XGBoost machine learning algorithm. The notebook covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training with XGBoost, and model evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about cell dimensions and whether the cell is malignant or benign. The features include:

Cell Radius
Cell Texture
Cell Perimeter
Cell Area
Cell Smoothness
Cell Compactness
Cell Symmetry
Cell Fractal Dimension

The target variable is binary:

0: Benign (non-cancerous cell)
1: Malignant (cancerous cell)
Dependencies

following libraries installed:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost

Detecting cancer cells early is crucial for effective treatment. This project demonstrates how machine learning algorithms like XGBoost can be used to classify cells as malignant or benign based on their dimensions. By leveraging the power of XGBoost and feature engineering, we can achieve high accuracy and make reliable predictions.
